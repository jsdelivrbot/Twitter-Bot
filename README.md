# Twitter-Bot

bot.js = searches for tweets

bot2.js = post a tweet

bot3.js = if I receive a follower, bot will reply back to the follower with a auto reply

bot4.js = uploads a picture and tweet to my twitter

to run these you need to download node.js, make sure to install node_module, change file directories in the code, and have your own twitter configuration keys
